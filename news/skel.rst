**Added:**

* New ``conda smithy ci-skeleton`` subcommand that generates ``conda-forge.yml``
  and ``recipe/meta.yaml`` files for using conda-forge / conda-smithy as
  the CI configuration outside of configuration. Calling ``rerender`` after
  ``ci-skeleton`` will generate the configuration files. This is a great way to
  either bootstrap CI for a repo or continue to keep CI up-to-date.
  The ``recipe/meta.yaml`` that is generated is just a stub, and will need to
  be filled out for CI to properly build and test.
