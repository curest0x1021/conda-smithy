**Added:**

* Added native aarch64 support for builds using Drone.io. This can be enabled by
  either using `provider: {linux_aarch64: drone}` or `provider: {linux_aarch64:
  native}` in the conda-forge.yml.
  
  Currently, drone has to be enabled manually as there is no automatic CI
  registration for repos.
